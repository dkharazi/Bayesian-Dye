## Overview

An experiment was conducted to observe fiber optical properties. The goal of the analysis is to model the dependence of fabric reflectance on denier per filament. This model, which treats each filament in a yarn bundle independently, has been extended to include multifilament scattering. The new model is used to predict the reflectance properties of a series of simulated yarn bundles with different numbers of filaments, providing further insight into the interaction of light with a fabric. Two effects of reducing denier per filament are predicted: decreased dye yield and increased back-scattering. The dye yield data are in agreement with the empirical relationship that the amount of dye required to achieve a given depth of shade varies as the inverse square root of the denier per filament.
